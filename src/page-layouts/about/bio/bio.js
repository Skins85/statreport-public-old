                    <p>
                        I first began coding in 2010 following a career change from journalism. Beginning 
                        as a CMS Editor, I learnt on the job and in my own time, initially understanding 
                        HTML and CSS before using JavaScript to interact with the DOM. Whilst learning the 
                        fundamentals of JavaScript, I also learned how to use third-party libraries such as 
                        jQuery and jQueryUI.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over time I became interested in combining front-end design with 
                        data. Around 2013 I began learning PHP and the first iteration of this site was built 
                        in this language (see <a href="https://github.com/Skins85/statreport">GitHub repository</a>). 
                        It was a great learning curve as I became familiar with creating JSON feeds to populate 
                        data-rich templates. As my projects became more involved, I learned the 
                        value of version control and code integrity using Git.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the end of 2019 I decided the time was right to rewrite StatReport 
                        in React and Node as JavaScript has become my primar programming language. Whilst it's 
                        been a big undertaking, the scope and possibilities of modern JS frameworks has allowed 
                        me to develop a more agile UI and moduralise my site into components.

                        As time goes by I hope to add to this site with new technologies and ideas. My full

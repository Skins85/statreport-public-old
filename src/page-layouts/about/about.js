                        My name is Mark Skinsley and I’m a full-time Web Developer and lifelong 
                        Dagenham & Redbridge supporter.  I created this site because I’ve always 
                        had a passion for statistics and wanted to apply this to the team I love.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is an unofficial site and the data used is purely through research 
                        from old match reports, websites and matchday programmes. Therefore it 
                        may not be 100% accurate (see <a href='../disclaimer'>Disclaimer</a>); if you spot any errors please&nbsp;
                        <a href='mailto:statreportuk@gmail.com'>get in touch</a>. Equally, if there are any ideas for content, please let me 
                        know as my goal is to continually develop the website and add new features 
                        when time allows.

                        On the tech side, templates are built in ReactJS and server interactions 
                        by Node. Styling is SCSS and there are some third-party libraries such as 
                        ChartJS used to build the underlying functionality of the charts. My code 
                        is publicly available on <a href='https://github.com/Skins85/statreport-reactjs'>GitHub</a>&nbsp;
                        and you can find out more about me on my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-skinsley-9b4635a7'>LinkedIn page</a>. Further 
                        information is also available in my <a href='./about/bio'>Bio</a>.
